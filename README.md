<h1>Data Skills Showcase</h1>

Creating this repository to showcase my Data Visualisation Skills, I've produced reports using large data sets with millions of results, joining and collating relevant data from different databases using SQL.

I am passionate about showcasing data in a way that is informative and educational for those that may be beginners but also provides value to those who are stakeholders or involved with the organisations/protocols I have created reports on. I'm currently in the top 10 contributors to MetricsDao.

I will create a Website that will visually present the information in this repository in the next few days.

Here is the work I am most proud of so far:
